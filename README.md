# Silent Failure on Malformed JSON POST Request in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in Express.js applications: the silent failure when receiving malformed JSON in the request body of a POST request.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js code accepts POST requests to the `/users` route expecting JSON data.  However, if the request body is not valid JSON (e.g., contains syntax errors), the application does not throw an error, and the request handler doesn't receive the expected data.  This makes debugging difficult, as the failure isn't readily apparent.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with an invalid JSON body (e.g., missing a closing brace).
5. Observe that the server doesn't log any errors and the request handler doesn't receive the data.

## Solution

The solution involves using a middleware function to parse the JSON body and handle potential errors explicitly.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code.
